## Description
This project was developed within the course "Human-Computer Interaction" at the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens. "My-Stydies", is a university website/dashboard accessed by professors, students and the university secretariat.

Students can:
- see the detailed study program of their department, 
- declare each semester the courses they want to attend, 
- see their grades in each course, as well as 
- request a certificate from the secretary's office.

Teachers can:
- view the courses they have taken each semester and
